During my various tenures, I have influenced a variety of exciting programs. I currently
lead a UX/UI design practice at the City of Boroondara and notably, created an
experience strategy that aligns with the organisation’s transformation program
objectives, including the evolution of a design system. Previous to this I have consulted
on complex, multi-million dollar projects in the Telco space (NDA), delivering innovative
solutions reliant on data visualisation.


With my experience solving impactful problems, I create value by being able to work
simultaneously across experience and business outcomes, helping to reduce scope and
time. In addition, I have proficient knowledge of front-end technologies. I am an
advocate of LEAN UX with Agile development methodologies alongside proficient use of
a variety of industry recognised design tools. These are skills that aid seamless
collaboration and improved efficiencies within the delivery teams I work within. I have an
enthusiasm for emerging technologies and have obtained an industry recognised
credential in Developing AI/ML Strategies.
