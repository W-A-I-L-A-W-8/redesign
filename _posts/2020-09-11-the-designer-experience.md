I'm a Jekyll fan boy.  I have been tracking their progress for a few years now and as newer options emerge on the market, the better they seem to get.

As Jekyll say, it's: 

> “Simple, static, and blog-aware.”

From point of view it has a been dream tool, for creating an incredibly fast, static website without the clutter.  Precisely, the reason I built my own site using the platform.  I've been on Jekyll for probably, almost five years now so I wanted to write this piece to illustrate some of the main benefits I've reaped over the last few years and specifically from a Designers eye.

#### What do you need to know in order to get on with Jekyll
My main vocation is Product Design.  I've familiar with front end developer but I can safely say it's definitely not one of my fortes.  My brain is definitely more geared towards the design side.

Before you continue reading the next part here's a few things to consider before you plough head first into Jekyll.  Not that there's anything wrong with doing so.  After all that's how I got started.  But to help you reduce the amount of frustration you might experience I have listed a few pointers below.  I like to think I'm a half decent designer so a designer's prerogative is to consider the best possible experience.

* Understanding of NPM.
* Comfortable using a CLI.
* Knowledge / experienc eof templating languages (preferrably Liquid Templating).
* Theme customisation.
* Decent SASS skills so you can customise till your heart's content.
* Working knowledge of Github of happy to try.

#### Pain Points
After many years working with WordPress I was finding it increasingly cumbersome.  The experience was somewhat frustrating
slow, and painful to manage.

#### Solution
And that's the reason we're here talking about Jekyll.  Even for me, I discovered it was ridiculously simple.  What's more simplistic than taking text files and rendering them as HTML.  I enjoy a bit of coding from time to time but as a designer I want to focus on the design stuff and it was no different building my own website.  I wanted a painless, quick solution to get my portfolio up and running.  If only there was a faster way to write case studies.

#### Why?



### Summary
Fantastic tool for a designer who loves dev getting hands a little bit dirty that satisfies the tech/dev urges.
