I'm a Jekyll fan boy.  I have been tracking their progress for a few years now and as newer options emerge on the market, the better they seem to get.

As Jekyll say, it's: 

> “Simple, static, and blog-aware.”

A designers dream tool for creating an incredibly fast, static website without the clutter.  Precisely, the reason I built my own site using the platform.

#### Pain Points
After many years working with WordPress I was finding it increasingly cumbersome.  The experience was somewhat frustrating a
slow site, easy for a designer to manage.

#### Solution
Jekyll

#### Why?



### Summary
Fantastic tool for a designer who loves dev getting hands a little bit dirty that satisfies the tech/dev urges.
