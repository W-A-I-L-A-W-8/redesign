I am curious and introspective. I am most interested in designing accessible, meaningful experiences for societal benefit. I am passionate about design systems and applying systematic approaches to crafting user interfaces. The evidence always informs the direction of my design outcomes.

#### Who am I?
I hale from the small seaside town of Hunstanton in the UK. You might find it in Google Maps. Typically, I grew up in a Chinese restaurant that my parents owned and went to my local high school. During my time there, the late Queen Elizabeth II visited m school and awarded the main building a Grade 2 Listed status. For those interested it was and still is a brutalist style of architecture.

I have a wife, a pair of children, a Scottish Terrier and we all live in Melbourne, Australia. I love tiny home videos, whisky cocktails and I've walked a marathon but I'm yet to run one.
