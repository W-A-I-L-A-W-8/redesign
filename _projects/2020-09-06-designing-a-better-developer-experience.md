#### Pain Points
* Design inconsistency. 
* No clarity on how to implement designs.

#### Solution
Obviously a solution was needed.  Some sort of design framework, a simple set of design rules that could be easily interpreted and implemented.  There was a need to be able to constantly evolve our designs.  Enter Storybook js.

Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

#### Why?
design and develop ui components in isolation. As great as this is for devs it is also a fantastic experience for the designers and any future members in our team. Provides a framework and guidelines to work with. Can be kept updated and current.

Deliver robust UIs
Storybook provides a sandbox to build UI components in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases.

Storybook makes it easy to keep track of edge cases and as a result you get tests for free.
