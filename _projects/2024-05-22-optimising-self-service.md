> “How might we enhance the mobile interface so customers can find and complete tasks efficiently?”

#### Background
The self-service options on the home page were experiencing low adoption. Engagement on mobile devices was almost non-existent. Disorganised information and cluttered interfaces information was seemingly difficult to find. On top of this, accessibility standards were below par causing task abandonment and as a consequence, putting pressure on the Customer Connect team.

#### What people were saying

> “How do I pay my fine”

> “What day are my bins collected”

> “I can’t find the task I want to complete”

Heatmap studies showed sporadic scanning patterns and not what was expected. During IA usability testing (current state), I observed frustration around the sub-navigation area. There were friction inducing forms. The layout was causing problems and slower than expected to complete.

#### Design Objectives
Using the actionable insights extracted from research I was able to achieve the following:

* Build structure.
	* Focus the attention on search and tasks.
	* The page info was restructured so crucial content was displayed in prominent areas of the page.
	* Influence visitors and guide them to take action.
* Put the emphasis on the top tasks.
	* Colour and texture to draw attention and prompt action.
* Clear and concise content.
	* Collaboration with Digital Content Team.
	* Plain language and content layout designed.
	* Media assets that showcase the benefits.
* Visual consistency.
	* Builds trust and familiarity.
	* Refined colour scheme, typography and assets.
* Ensure accessibility for diverse audiences.

#### The result
Data extracted from a 2 month period after release.

* 40 top tasks reduced to the 9 ordered by popularity, informed by data.
* 158% increase in unique clicks across the 9 top tasks.
* Mobile usage on top tasks increased from 2% to 41%.
* Overall usability of the website scored high at 81.4 (A)
* Achieved “Strong” accessibility standards, WCAG Level 2.1 AA.

#### Parting Thoughts
The results were outstanding. It was successful due to the quality of the insights coupled with usability heuristics and intended design choices. Removing the categories navigation was an impactful decision. Another significant change was the experience of the search bar in mobile. It expands and collapses which allows it to be hidden when not in use. The data gave me the confidence in my rationale and eliminating categories reduced the physical and mental effort for the user. Less tasks, less buttons, less complicated and much easier to complete an action.
