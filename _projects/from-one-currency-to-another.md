#### **Introduction**

**Reinvigorate the movement of funds**

Originally launched as an enterprise SaaS product to fulfil an urgent business need but unfortunately it was never designed.

The company’s goal being to provide a hassle-free business account solution specifically for overseas, education providers managing their cash-flow.

**The purpose being to:**

* Pay someone, get paid &
* Transfer currencies.

#### **My Role**

#### **Aligning design with strategic goals**

In a consulting capacity with 3 months at my disposal I was embedded to provide a tactical approach for improving overall experience of the platform and implement a way to scale and maintain assets.

**At the end of my tenure I delivered:**

* A documented set of discovery insights
* UI Kit with a set of mobile specific components (Still in evolution)
* Concepts for a mobile app solution
* The foundations of a design system

> Build retention and grow the user base

###### **The Challenge**

### No clear direction

At the outset of the project there wasn’t a clear vision or specific goals for the experience. Without pre-existing insights, I partnered with our product owner to understand who the users were and how they were currently using the platform to move money around.

###### **The Approach**

### Collect some data and hit some stats

**_What do we know already? What do we need to know?_**

After interviewing my key stakeholder (Also CEO) and Tech Lead I was now suitably armed with assumptions.

**Leveraging data to drive innovation**

The plan at this stage was to take the hypothesis and develop it into testable solutions.

* Usability testing would help us to identify core stages of the money transfer flow where users might struggle.
* Web analytics and heatmaps to show for example, how many users abandon the process.

###### **User Needs**

### Ask the audience

> ## I can’t find what I’m looking for

> ## It’d be good to see the current exchange rate

> ## What can I pay with?

Through some quick mapping activities and interviews with users we gleaned the following insights:

**Missing payment options**

The payer did not understand how and what payment options were available to them.

**Long-winded forms**

Not only were forms on the long side but micro-copy and form layout were all elements ripe for improvement..

**Useful information**

We discovered that people would like a level of personalisation in their interface. Simple data showing transfer history, pending transfers were all deemed useful. People also desired live data in the form of currency tools such as current foreign exchange rates.

###### **What does the current experience look like?**

### Judging the user interface

**Heuristic evaluation** · Following Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design.

**Key problem areas:**

**Visibility of system status**

* Users were confused. They were not being informed and uncertainty was on the rise which usually implies that user confidence is low.

**Irrelevant information**

* E.g. No purpose to this static map below.

**Flexibility & efficiency of use**

* Keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures
* Opportunity for personalisation
* Allow for customisation

###### **Competitive UX Analysis**

### What others are doing?

**Purpose:** To identify key usability strengths and weaknesses.

**Analysis Objectives**

Review the features and functionality we observed throughout the various competitors’ websites and then provide several recommendations.

**We want to learn:**

1. How efficient it is to use.
2. Are interactions predictable and intuitive.
3. Could communication of system status be improved.

**Strengths:**

* **A**
* **B**
* **C**

**Weaknesses:**

* **A**
* **B**
* **C**
