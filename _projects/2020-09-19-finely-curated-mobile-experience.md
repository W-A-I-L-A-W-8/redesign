#### From cluttered desktop to tidy small devices
So, how do you transform this tired, cluttered desktop UI into a finely crafted mobile experience keeping all the features and functionality?  Curation is key.

This is a B2B platform for booking and managing hotel reservations.  It is not consumer facing, the persona is the travel agent.

#### My Role

The was prodominently a UX piece for me.  My role was to deliver the best possible experience across multiple devices sizes.  Fortunately, I have designed a number of travel related applications for mobile in a previous life so I was pretty confident we could release a great outcome. 

#### Pain Points
The primary problem here was not the lack of content but how we squeeze it all onto the small screen.  We ran some research and we discovered that cognitively, it presented a problem to many users.

Mobile UX design can be tricky business.  There are so many things we have to consider, including the growing list of mobile devices, the ways people interact with them, and the fact that people want consistent and pleasurable experiences across all device types.

Given the constraint on time to deliver and that the user persona could be using this application across a number of different screen resolutions, we knew early on in the process that the approach had to be responsive so we could forget about doing a native application.  It meant we would have to define some effective breakpoints.

#### Here's how it unfolded
Part of successfully curating a great mobile experience is to prioritise.  By this I mean removing as much clutter as possible and only leaving what is absolutely necessary, based on the user's needs.  In this case, the key tasks they would be performing.

As Antoine de Saint-Exupery said,

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

#### Above the fold
It was established that our user would be primarily using the interface to check hotel availability and this could happen at anytime of the day, from anywhere.  They could be sitting in a coffee shop or in a car during a school pick up.  Secondly, the user would be using the application to manage their bookings.

All frequently performed tasks needed to be readily available and the navigation needed to be clean and crisp.

#### Image carousels

The wireframes illustrate a cleaner UI, using familiar componenet sets to display that data.
